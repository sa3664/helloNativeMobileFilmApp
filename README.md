1. First step would be to set up the development environment that includes making sure that the node version is higher that 12.

2. We can either have the expo-client application installed in our Phone for the same and logged in with your expo account to see the application on the phone. Or else we can install the Android Studio and create a virtual device as an emulator and Expo automatically installs the expo client app in the emulator, so we would not need to do that explicitly.

3. We can then open the zipped folder and login with your expo account in the terminal .

4. The last step would be to start the expo server which will open up a browser showing a metro Bundler which is a JavaScript bundler for React Native .There would be multiple options to choose for running he application, so we can choose as required .
